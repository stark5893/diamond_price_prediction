📈 Linear Regression Model

This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression implementation to predict numerical outcomes based on input features. It's designed for beginners and data science learners to understand how regression models work using Python and Scikit-learn.

📌 Project Overview

**Objective**: Predict continuous numerical values based on given independent variable(s)
**Domain**: General (can be applied to business, economics, science, etc.)
**Type**: Regression Problem
**Tech Stack**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset

**Source**: Synthetic or manually created sample dataset
**Features**: One or more independent variables (X)
**Target Variable**: Dependent variable (Y)

🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loaded dataset using Pandas
   - Cleaned and formatted the data
   - Visualized the relationship between variables

2. **Modeling**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Trained a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn
   - Predicted outcomes on the test set

3. **Evaluation**
   - Calculated metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error
   - Visualized regression line and prediction performance

📊 Visualization

- Scatter plot of actual data
- Best-fit regression line
- Residual plot to evaluate error distribution

✅ Results

- **Model Used**: Linear Regression (scikit-learn)
- **Evaluation Metric**: R² Score
- **Performance**: Demonstrates a clear linear relationship with good fit (details in notebook)
